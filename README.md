Motivation & Problem Statement:

Indian statistics reveal that more than 60% accidents occur during night time. Poor visibility, driver’s visual fatigue & performance etc were identified as prime factors for more accidents during night time. Visibility is related to the factors like scattered right, insufficient light, reflection of lights, eyes power to regain its original vision etc., During night one’s judgment
will be poor and cannot able to judge other vehicle’s speed correctly. To avoid poor visibility, proper designing of illumination system is stressed. During night, being seen is an important as seeing. Road Geometry will sometimes mar the visibility which may cause accidents.Driver’s fatigue is more during night since the driver is doing his work against the nature.

The task is to develop a design for a product which can be used to reduce the accidents occurring during night time in an efficient manner.

A Brief understanding of the product:
The design takes advantage of the 2 thermographic cameras and images produced by them to detect any animals, humans or vehicles present in the vicinity of the device. As soon as any of the above mentioned entities is detected a stream of light will be projected in the direction of the detection which lets the driver realise it’s presence and therefore, warns him/her to be extra cautious.
